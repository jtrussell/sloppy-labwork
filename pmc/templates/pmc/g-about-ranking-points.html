  <h1>Ranking Points</h1>

  <p>The tables below show the ranking points awarded for finishing positions at
  events of various sizes.</p>

  <p>In general, our philosophy is to reward consistency and
 attendance as well as performance. A player who attends every event in a month 
 will most likely outrank a player who attends only one event in that
 month, even if the latter player wins their one event.</p>
