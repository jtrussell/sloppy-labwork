        Your Level (Lv) is an at-a-glance view of your overall progression and participation in KeyForge 
        organized play through KeyChain, earned over time by accruing Experience Points (XP). Your level 
        appears on your player profile, and additional personalization items can be unlocked through leveling 
        up. Higher levels generally require more XP to level up.

            Experience Points (XP) are earned for general participation in KeyForge organized play across all 
            playgroups, and serve as the foundation for your overall KeyChain account progression. Earning XP 
            is how you level up. XP is awarded as such:

            Ranking Points (RP) are a leaderboard ranking metric used for
            determining player placements and standings across events. There are
            global leaderboards, as well as leaderboards within individual
            playgroups.
        </span>
        <p>
            Each leaderboard has associated periods, or timeframes, over which
            players will collect RP and hope to be crowned champion. Currently,
            there are three different period lengths supported in KeyChain:
        </p>
        <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Monthly </strong>leaderboards collect RP earned between the first and last day of a given month.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Season </strong>leaderboard periods span an entire year, from December 1st through November 30th of the following year. These are timed to coincide with Ghost Galaxyâ€™s organized play schedule, ending just after KeyForge Celebration.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>All Time</strong> leaderboards have a single period with no end date.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In order for RP to be considered for a given leaderboard, it must be
            earned and recorded between the start and end (plus one week) of the
            relevant period.
